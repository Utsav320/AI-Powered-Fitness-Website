The AI-Powered Fitness Website is an interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with APIs, a virtual assistant, and a chatbot. The platform responds to user commands and provides personalized fitness guidance, including categorized workout routines with animated GIF demonstrations for each exercise.

This project demonstrates how AI and API integration can be combined with frontend web technologies to create a smart, engaging, and user-friendly fitness experience.
